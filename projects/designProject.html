It is created in collaboration with the other members of the studentgroup Cloud9 (Sofie Juul Nisted, Eva Sørensen, Erna Rokne Holst). We wanted to work with bullying within children/youngsters and how to stop or prevent it. Bullying is a big problem and around 6% around the age of 11 experience bullying monthly. We followed a very classic design-process. First we worked with research and ideation and thereafter prototyping and user involvement.</p></div><div class="ImageCollageWithThreeImages_container__RINUb Section"><div class="ImageCollageWithThreeImages_firstImage__O9U81 Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/forside.png"/></div><div class="ImageCollageWithThreeImages_wrapper__lV2oZ"><div class="ImageCollageWithThreeImages_image__AwPwg Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/kortSpil.png"/></div><div class="ImageCollageWithThreeImages_image__AwPwg Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/ordRegn.png"/></div></div></div><div class="myRoleContainer"><div><h2>My Role in this Project</h2><p class="textProjects">My role within this project has mainly been to keep the bigger picture and to make sure we keep up with the timeplan and all the deadlines. I have also been a big part of the process and developing the prototype where I have focused on the card game. Beside keeping the bigger picture and prototyping, I have also been a part of the subteam that have planed and hosted the intial workshop.</p></div><img class="profil-picture" id="profileOnProject" src="/images/profile.jpg"/></div><div class="Section"><h3>Related Works</h3><p class="rte">There has been an increased focus on bullying in schools in the last decade and how it can be prevented. There are some related works as to how games can be implemented into schools for improving children’s reflective skills and how it can prevent bullying and encourage inclusive behavior. Kriglstein et al. presents the project “Be a Buddy not a Bully” which consists of two educational games, both focusing on bullying and how to prevent it. The goal of the games is making the user take on the role of a bystander to different bullying situations instead of the victim or bully. Kriglstein et al. follow a very narrative dramaturgical approach, whereas we plan to use a different approach containing multiple small games instead. What Muravevskaia et al. explores in their research is how children can improve/develop their awareness and empathy through games and narratives such as fairy tales. As well as in our own project, the game is seen as a motivational and engaging tool for children to reflect upon feelings. The game was developed with both an auditory, visual and kinesthetic aspect to engage the children, and even though some evaluations of this was missing, it seems that we also should consider including several modalities as well - why this could be a good idea also supported by our findings in our semi-structured interview. The game “StopBully”, developed by Cátia Raminhos et al. presents a Serious Game centering on the perspectives of two roles; bystander and victim, in order to change the behaviors of these when faced with situations of bullying. The intention is for the game to be played by a child in company with a psychologist, where the child will make decisions based on the role they are playing and the situation. The approach in StopBully differentiates from ours in that they make a dedicated choice to focus on bullying as a theme and the roles related. In our approach, it is central that the theme is underlying, because the key values in our design are positivity and inclusiveness. Therefore, focusing directly on the negative loaded theme of bullying, and essentially separating people into roles, will defeat the purpose of our approach. Elsayed-Ali et al. have been working with children in a co-design session in order to gain insights into the value-systems of their desired demographic. By having the participating children rank their values using the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS), the team were able to gather how children view the world and their own needs. For our own project, we decided to work with adult pedagogical experts (rather than actual children) to gain insight. Using this approach, we will get an academic view of the issue but not the first hand experience of the children who will eventually be the users of our product. However, we will have children of the appropriate age group test our prototype in the evaluation phase.</p><div class="TextBlockWithTwoImagesUnder_container__rD_qu"></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_container__S9n8t Section"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_slider__TcVmH"><div class="swiper TextBlockWithImage_swiper__hAbGO"><div class="swiper-button-prev"></div><div class="swiper-button-next"></div><div class="swiper-pagination"></div><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_slide__42XWl Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/brainstorm1.jpg"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_slide__42XWl Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/brainstorm2.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_slide__42XWl Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/brainstorm3.png"/></div></div></div></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_text__MU9IN"><h3 class="TextBlockWithImage_title__pHL7B">Initial brainstorm</h3><p class="rte">Initaly we used a rapid ideation brainstorming exercise where we got five minutes to create as many ideas possible. This method allowed us to get a broad and extensive idea catalog to use as our startingpoint. To narrow down the idea catalog we used a three-dot-method where everyone get three votes. We often choose to use this method early on in the process to narrow down the ideas and to see if we are more or less on the same page.</p></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_container__S9n8t Section"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_text__MU9IN"><h3 class="TextBlockWithImage_title__pHL7B">Background - Research and ethics</h3><p class="rte">When developing a designsolution to a problem or case you have to do a lot of research around the topic. This is especially important when working with a problem as bullying where you need to make sure you know where to focus and how big of a problem it is. We wanted to do a theoretical framing instead of doing a lot of etnographic studies. We chose to do this because we are working with children and that makes it a more delicate process to include them this early on. We chose two directions to do research in: a qualitative and a quantitative. I mainly focused on the qualitative.</p></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_container__S9n8t Section"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_image__xcIT0 Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/brainstorm2.jpg"/></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_text__MU9IN"><h3 class="TextBlockWithImage_title__pHL7B">Second brainstorm</h3><p class="rte"><p>In our second brainstorming session we worked with some of the same methods as in the first. We also included the method Worst Ideas. The purpose of this brainstorming session was to figure out our main designkoncept. We ended up with two main ideas:<ol><li><i>A game where the students learn about and work with bullying</i></li><li><i>A device/installation displaying an output based on some input about bullying.</i></li></ol>We then worked with our third and final ideation session to choose a final plan/concept. We chose to work with a computer game with the possibility of getting a streak and playing games that teach about antibullying and so on..</p></p></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_container__S9n8t Section"><div class="TextBlockWithImage_text__MU9IN"><h3 class="TextBlockWithImage_title__pHL7B">Inital interview and findings</h3><p class="rte">We chose to hold a semi-structured interview/workshop for a small group of students teachers (who a halfway done with their studies).

The participants worked as experts in the field.</p></div><div class="TextBlockWithImage_image__xcIT0 Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/interview.jpg"/></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_container__IBTMf Section"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_text__uZjYC"><h3 class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_title__OGcIn">Initial prototype</h3><p class="rte">After gathering all our findings from the interview, the survey and research we continued to start to prototype. Before our interview we held a brainstorming session focusing on narrowing down what features and basic structure our game should have. We chose to do the first prototyping session individualy to generate some idea that wasen&#x27;t affected by each others ideas. Our individual assignment was to <i>create two low-fidelty prototypes one of the overall interface and one of a game concept.</i> We then went on to present the ideas infront of the other group members with the intention to get closer to one concept/idea to create a final prototype of.</p></div><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slider___SyIH"><div class="swiper TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_swiper__BGFHB"><div class="swiper-button-prev"></div><div class="swiper-button-next"></div><div class="swiper-pagination"></div><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/ideSpilSigne.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/kortIdeEva.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/interfaceSigne.png"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/interview.jpg"/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="Section"><h3>Final prototype</h3><p class="rte">The idea we went with as the main interface flow was idea B (as you can see above) <i>a frontpage with a plant that needs to be cared for by the entire class as one unit.</i> This idea appealed the most to us because the class would need to work together rather than agianst each other. The idea of a plant that would turn yellow and sad if it isnt cared for is also a great illustration of what happens if we don&#x27;t take care of each other. Since we chose to work with a target group of third graders choosing to work with a illustration based interface would allow any one to participate no matter what reading level you are on.<br/><br/>The video above shows the interaction flow when a student is interacting with the platform. FICUS is not only the name of the platform, but also the name of the plant. The aim is to give the students something to work together on and where they need each others to succes instead of creating individual competion between them. They need to play games from the game catalog to get points which they collect together as a class to copmete against the other classes. When they finish/win a game they do not only get points they also get to water FICUS (as illustrated in the video). If the class doesn&#x27;t work together FICUS will start to wither and they will loose points. So teamwork is a key component for the game without it the class will loose.</p><div class="TextBlockWithTwoImagesUnder_container__rD_qu"></div></div><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_container__IBTMf Section"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_text__uZjYC"><h3 class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_title__OGcIn">Expo 2022</h3><p class="rte"></p></div><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slider___SyIH"><div class="swiper TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_swiper__BGFHB"><div class="swiper-button-prev"></div><div class="swiper-button-next"></div><div class="swiper-pagination"></div><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/expo2.jpg"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/expo.jpg"/></div></div><div class="swiper-slide"><div class="TextBlockWithSliderGalleryUnder_slide__K7zZc Image_Image__fS_IG Image_Image--cover__mNxFF"><img src="/images/expo3.jpg"/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="layout_backToHome__C0Q_T"><a href="/">← Back to home</a></div><div class="themeToggle noselect"></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/projects/designProject","query":{},"buildId":"Y2bjsoppqo-QRHRhWa6ju","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
